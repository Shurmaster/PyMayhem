## Description
PyMayhem is a digital version of the tabletop card game "Dungeon Mayhem."  
It's implemented using Python 3, and the PyGame and SQLite libraries.  
https://www.pygame.org/news  
https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html

The game is restricted to two-player only, and requiring the two players  
to share the same device they play on.

Card data is stored in a database and accessed by the game. The other features  
are object oriented, relying on classes to build the game.

Originally, our delegation of work was as follows:
- Aldo: Game logic
- Skylar: Databases, game logic
- Finley: GUI
- Emily: GUI
- Kajoyrie: Game logic  
But as time passed, work on certain features had a lot of crossover, so everyone
worked on a little bit of everything.
